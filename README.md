# Project-1-Checkers-

## Description:

A two-player checkers game developed for my second General Assembly project

## Technical Requirements

1. Render game in browser
2. Include win/loss logic and render win/loss messages in HTML
3. Include separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
4. Use vanilla JavaScript or jQuery
5. Have properly indented HTML, CSS & JavaScript
6. No remaining dead and/or commented out code
7. Code in a consistent manner
8. Deployed online using gitHub

## Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- GitHub
- Netlify

## Getting Started:

- [Link to game](https://george-checker-game.netlify.app/)

- Instructions:
  1. Determine a player 1 & player 2
  2. Player 1 selects a black piece to move diagonally towards the top of the screen (player 2 will move a red piece diagonally towards the bottom of the screen)
  3. Player 1 chooses the square they wish to move the selected piece to by clicking on a yellow square (representing possible moves)
  4. If possible, player 1 must capture a red piece by skipping over that piece to the available square diagonally behind it (will appear yellow)
  5. If possible, player 1 must continue to capture pieces after the first jump, so long as there is an available square diagonally behind a red piece (will appear yellow)
  6. Once player 1 has moved a single square or captured as many pieces in a row as possible, player 2 begins their turn
  7. If any of a player's pieces make it to the opposite end of the board, those pieces become "kings" (represented by a gold ring around the piece) which can then move and capture forward and backward
  8. Once a player captures all 12 of their opponent's pieces, the game is over!

## Next steps:

- [Link to Github Repository](https://github.com/georgeperryv/Project-1-Checkers-)
- Incorporate animations to slide pieces when moved or captured
- Render king pieces (i.e., displaying a gold ring) in the captured section when a king is captured
- When "Start New Game" button is clicked, create a pop up asking if the player is sure they want to restart
